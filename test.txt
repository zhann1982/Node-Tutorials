 The **storeAs()** leads to the folder you'll be pushing the image to, for example
```storage/app/photos/
``` . Then you use the **$fileStore** variable to store in the database.

STEP THREE: Fetching the image

To fetch the image, call on the column name on the database like **photo** then use this line of code

```$photo = $user['photo'];
        $path = "https://sh-ei.org/admin/api/storage/app/photos/" . $photo;
```
You can edit it to call on the current **path** and **column**.
